OOP: // Flow Controlled using If Else Block
FOP: // Flow Controlled using Map of Input-Key and Function-Object

Pros of FOP and Cons of OOP:
Follows Open-Closed Principle and Subsitution Principle and thus Simpler to use

Cons of FOP and Pros of OOP:
Abstracted over Object and thus requires Extra Configuration (To easily achieve this reflection apis are used)
